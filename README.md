# The Odin Project "Calculator" Project  


Completed as the closing project for the Foundations Course.  


The core concept of this project was inspired by the Calculator Project in collaboration with Zell Liew and Kevin Powell. While the most recent version was streamed on YouTube, the original Part 2, available on Zell's [website}(https://zellwk.com/blog/calculator-part-2/), provided immense help in handling "edge cases." 
However, the original project requirements did not ask for certain improvements, as multiple operations, I wanted to go the extra mile and append the extra functionalities.  


I aimed not to stay on the happy path and improved the original design tailored to my liking. The project was expanded in various ways, including the addition of different memory-related buttons and, most notably, the separation of the display into two parts.  


Considering this as my first major project, I learned a lot throughout the process, starting from manipulating the DOM, utilising ternary operators and datasets, adding keyboard support and wrapping up with significant code refactoring.  


## Future Features: 
* A history tab
* Indication when memory is overwritten
